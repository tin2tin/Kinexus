## How to Get Started

Creating your first game is a straightforward process. The app handles all the file and folder setup for you.

### 1. Create or Open a Project
First, open Kinexus in your browser. From the **Menu**, you have two options:
*   **New Project:** Creates a complete project folder for you, including sub-folders for `images` and `sounds`, and the main `story.json` file.
*   **Open Existing Project:** Lets you select a project folder you previously created.

### 2. Create Your Story
*   **Create Scenes:** Use the **round blue '+' button** above the scene list to create new scenes. Give them short, unique IDs (e.g., `start`, `cockpit`, `alien_encounter`).
*   **Navigate:** Click any scene in the Story Map to load it into the editor. Right-click a scene for more options, like **"Set as Start Scene"**.
*   **Edit Content:** Write your narrative in the "Story Text" area. You can use simple markdown for formatting, like `**bold**`, `*italics*`, and `[links](https://example.com)`. The formatting is visible in the live preview, the player, and the final exported game.
*   **Add Choices:** Click the **round blue '+' button** below the choices list. Write the text the player will see and select the target scene from the dropdown menu.

### 3. Create Dynamic Stories with Variables and Conditions
*   **Manage Variables:** Click the `{...}` button next to "Add Choice". In the modal, add new true/false variables to track game state (e.g., `has_key`).
*   **Set a Variable:** Create a choice and in its destination dropdown, select a variable (e.g., `var_has_key`). You can then set it to `true` or `false`. Leave the button text blank for a silent, automatic action.
*   **Add a Condition:** Click the condition icon (`â†’`) on any choice. In the new view, you can set the choice to only appear if a variable is true/false or if a specific scene has been visited.

### 4. Add Media (Image & Audio)
You have multiple ways to add media:
1.  **File Picker:** Click the **yellow folder icon** next to the "Image" or "Audio" field.
2.  **Drag & Drop:** Drag an image or audio file from your file explorer directly onto the text input field.
3.  **Generative AI (Images):** Write a prompt in the "AI Image Prompt" box and click the **purple Render button**. Once you're happy with the result, click the **green Add button** to add it to your scene.

The app automatically sets the correct path. The file will be copied into your project's `images/` or `sounds/` folder when you click **"Save Project"**.

### 5. Customize the Look & Feel
Click the **Style Editor icon** (next to the Menu button). Use the controls to change your game's layout, fonts, colors, and even add background music. Your style settings are saved with your project.

### 6. Save & Export
*   **Save Project:** Click the main **"Save Project"** button in the Menu. This saves all your work to the `story.json` file inside your project folder. **Save frequently!**
*   **Export Standalone Game:** When your game is complete, click **"Menu**" -> "**Export Standalone Game**". This packages your story, all required assets, and your custom theme into a single `.zip` file that you can share or upload anywhere. This is the final, playable product.

## The `story.json` File Format

The entire state of a Kinexus project is stored in a single JSON file named `story.json`. This file contains all story text, choices, variables, and styling information.

The top-level structure is a single JSON object with two keys: `meta` and `scenes`.
```json
{
  "meta": { ... },
  "scenes": { ... }
}
```

---

### The `meta` Object
This object contains global information and settings for the project.

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `title` | String | Yes | The title of your story. This appears in the player's UI. |
| `startSceneId` | String | Yes | The ID of the scene where the story begins. Must match a valid key in the `scenes` object. |
| `creatorName` | String | No | The name of the author, displayed in the "About" section. Defaults to an empty string. |
| `aboutText` | String | No | A description of the project, displayed in the "About" section. Defaults to an empty string. |
| `variables` | Array | Yes | An array of strings, where each string is the unique name of a boolean variable used in the game. |
| `layout` | String | Yes | Defines the player's visual layout. Must be one of `layout-image-as-bg`, `layout-top-down`, or `layout-side-by-side`. |
| `styles` | Object | Yes | An object containing key-value pairs for CSS variables that control the player's appearance (fonts, colors, etc.). |

#### Example `meta` Object:
```json
"meta": {
  "title": "The Last Broadcast",
  "startSceneId": "start",
  "creatorName": "Jane Doe",
  "aboutText": "A short interactive fiction story about a mysterious signal.",
  "variables": [
    "power_restored",
    "has_keycard"
  ],
  "layout": "layout-top-down",
  "styles": {
    "--bg-color": "#1a1a1a",
    "--text-color": "#e0e0e0",
    "--btn-color": "rgba(80, 80, 95, 1)",
    "--font-family": "sans-serif",
    "--music-path": "sounds/ambient_theme.mp3"
  }
}
```

---

### The `scenes` Object
This object acts as a dictionary containing all the individual scenes of the story. The key for each entry is the unique Scene ID, and the value is the corresponding scene object.

#### Structure of a Scene Object
Each scene object has the following structure:

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | String | Yes | The unique ID of the scene. Must match its key in the parent `scenes` object. |
| `text` | String | Yes | The main story text for this scene. Can contain markdown and can be an empty string. |
| `image` | String | No | The relative path to an image file for the scene (e.g., `images/control_room.jpg`). |
| `imagePrompt`| String | No | The text prompt used to generate an AI image for this scene. |
| `ambienceSound`| String | No | The relative path to a sound file for the scene (e.g., `sounds/static.mp3`). |
| `ambienceLoop`| Boolean | No | If `true` (the default), the `ambienceSound` will loop. If `false`, it will play once. |
| `choices` | Array | Yes | An array of choice objects. An empty array `[]` signifies a dead-end scene. |
| `lastModified`| Number | No | A timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) indicating when the scene was last saved. |

#### Structure of a Choice Object
A choice object defines the logic for a single player interaction, governed by an optional `condition` and a required `action`.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `condition`| Object/null | If not `null`, the choice is only shown if the condition is met. |
| `action` | Object | Defines what happens when the choice is triggered. |

**The `condition` Object:**
| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `variable`| String | The state to check. It can be a custom variable (e.g., `"var_power_restored"`) or a scene visit check (e.g., `"visited_scene_basement"`). |
| `value` | Boolean | The required state for the condition to be met (`true` or `false`). |

**The `action` Object:**
| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `text` | String | The text displayed on the choice button. If this is an empty string, the action is silent and triggers automatically when the scene loads. |
| `target` | String/null | The `id` of the scene that this choice leads to. `null` if the action only modifies a variable. |
| `set_variable`| String/null | The name of a variable to modify (e.g., `"has_keycard"`). `null` if the action only changes scene. |
| `set_value`| Boolean | The value to set the `set_variable` to (`true` or `false`). |

## Exporting as a Desktop Application (.exe, .app)

For a simple and powerful way to convert your Kinexus web export into a professional desktop application, we recommend using the **Build Standalone Application From HTML** tool.

This tool automates the entire process and provides several key advantages:
*   **Cross-Platform:** Build for Windows (.exe), macOS (.app), and Linux from a single tool.
*   **Easy to Use:** A simple graphical interface walks you through the process.
*   **Custom Icons:** Properly embeds your custom game icon into the final application.
*   **No Security Warnings:** Avoids the common issues with file blocking and security warnings.

### How to Use the Build Tool

1.  **Export Your Game from Kinexus:** Go to **Menu** -> **Export Standalone Game** to download the project `.zip` file. Unzip this file to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Download the Build Tool:** Go to the [Build Standalone Application From HTML repository](https://github.com/tin2tin/Build_Standalone_Application_From_HTML) and download the latest version for your operating system from the **Releases** page.

3.  **Prepare Your Icon:** Create a custom icon for your game (`.ico` for Windows, `.png`/`.icns` for macOS).

4.  **Run the Build Tool:** Launch the application and provide it with:
    *   The `index.html` file you exported from Kinexus.
    *   Your custom icon file.
    *   The name for your application.

5.  **Build and Distribute:** Click **'Build'**. The tool will package your game into a professional, standalone desktop application, ready to be zipped and distributed on platforms like [itch.io](https://itch.io/).
