Okay, now we need to work on the imageprompts, we must aim for character consistency, location and style consistency. So, every character, and location must have distinct visual elements, and these elements must be included in every imageprompt. Also, every imageprompt must be written by a cinematographer, only including the visuals, starting with angle, subject/character, situation, setting, location lighting(time of day), and style. In this case every Image prompt should start with "An unsigned black and white drawing of ", then camera angle etc. And it must always end with: ", in the art style of..."

Generate a single-line image prompt that starts with "An unsigned black and white drawing of ", followed by a cinematographic description (angle, subject/character, situation, setting, location, lighting/time of day), and ends with ", in the art style of...", ensuring every character and location has distinct, consistent visual elements included in every prompt.

Okay, now we need to work on the imageprompts, extract all charcters, and in a parentical descripe their individual distinct visuals(gender, age, face, hair, eyes, colors, clothes, colors etc. (ensure not two characters look the same) ) we must aim for character consistency, location and style consistency. So, every character, and location must have distinct visual elements, and these elements must be included in every imageprompt. Also, every imageprompt must be written by a cinematographer, only including the visuals, starting with angle, subject/character (gender, age, face, hair, eyes, colors, clothes, colors (always include the full description when mentioned in the image prompts)), situation, setting, location lighting(time of day), and style.
